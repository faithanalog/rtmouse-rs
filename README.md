# rtmouse, but rust

writing this to see what the rust version of [rtmouse](https://github.com/faithanalog/rtmouse) looks like. im also finding bugs in the original along the way!

- [x] core dwell functionality, direct port from original
- [ ] signal handling
- [ ] sound support
- [ ] refactor to be more rusty
- [ ] add comments back in
